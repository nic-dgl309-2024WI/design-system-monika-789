    <p>
      I'm from Punjab, India. I pursued Master's in Fine Arts and followed it up with a diploma in graphic design.
      Currently, I'm enrolled in a Digital Design + Development postgraduate diploma.
      What makes me unique is my proficiency in traditional art, and now, I'm eager to enhance my skills in digital art professionally.
